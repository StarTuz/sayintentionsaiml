**Key Rules:**

- Aircraft callsign FIRST, then facility identification
- "November" prefix for US N-numbers (e.g., "November One Two Three Alpha Bravo")
- After initial contact, callsign can be abbreviated to last three characters
- Word "cleared" is NOT used for taxi - use "taxi" or "proceed"
- Word "takeoff" ONLY used when issuing/canceling takeoff clearance

## Important Notes

1. **No "This is"** - Controllers do NOT say "This is Ground Control" - they say "Ground"
2. **Brevity** - Real ATC is extremely terse
3. **Readback Required** - Runway assignments, hold short instructions, cleared for takeoff/landing
4. **ATIS** - Pilots expected to have ATIS before contacting ATC
